                    Slab avalanches generally occur at slope angles between 30 and 45 degrees. On steeper slopes, snow doesnâ€™t typically
                    accumulate enough to form a slab, while shallower slopes are not steep enough for the snow to slide downhill.

                    terrain features and deposits snow on the downwind side. Wind slabs are often smooth and rounded and sometimes sound
                    hollow, and can range from soft to hard. Wind slabs that form over a persistent weak layer (surface hoar, depth hoar, or
                    near-surface facets) may be termed Persistent Slabs or may develop into Persistent Slabs. Typical wind loaded avalanche problems 
                    include cornice and windslabs.

                       Release of a cohesive layer of snow (a slab) that is generally moist or wet when the flow of liquid water weakens the
                       bond between the slab and the surface below (snow or ground). They often occur during prolonged warming events and/or
                       rain-on-snow events. Wet Slabs can be very destructive.

                        underlying persistent weak layer breaks. Persistent layers include: surface hoar, depth hoar, near-surface facets, or
                        faceted snow. Persistent weak layers can continue to produce avalanches for days, weeks or even months, making them
                        especially dangerous and tricky. As additional snow and wind events build a thicker slab on top of the persistent weak
                        layer, this avalanche problem may develop into a Deep Persistent Slab.

                        <b>Dry Loose: </b>
                        Dry Loose avalanches are the release of dry unconsolidated snow and typically occur within layers of soft snow near the
                        surface of the snowpack. These avalanches start at a point and entrain snow as they move downhill, forming a fan-shaped
                        avalanche. Other names for loose dry avalanches include point-releaseavalanches or sluffs.

            <b>AvySim</b> is a user input based avalanche simulator. Interact with the weather/terrain controllers on the right to modify conditions. If an avalanche is possible, click the <i>Start Avalanche</i> button to see the animation. Press the <i>Reset</i> button to reset slope and snow conditions. Information about the avalanche type will be displayed in the description box below. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For context on input requirements see below:
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Slope Angle: </b> Controls angle of slope on right side of mountain. Ideal avalanche slope occurs between 30-60 degrees.
            <br>
            <b>Snowpack: </b>Snowpack depth. Youre going to need some snow for there to be an avalanche.
            <br>
            <b>Temperature: </b>Temperature can have major effects on local snow conditions especially if combined with clear skies. High temperatures can lead to wet slide avalanches. 
            <br>
            <b>Windspeed: </b>Windspeed can cause wind loading, which is essentially piling up of snow on one side of the mountain. High winds can also lead to cornice formation (overhanging mass of hardened snow on the ridge of mountain) 
            <br>
            <b>Precipitation: </b>High precipitation can lead to both wet slides on storm slabs (depending on the temperature)
            <br>
            <b>Weak Layer: </b>A weak layer is a layer of snow that is poorly bonded to the layer on top of it. This makes it easy to for the top layer of snow to slide off. Common weak layer types include faceted snow, surface hoar, and depth hoar.
